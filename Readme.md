A music generation system that generates compositions consisting of of melodies and chords. 
The generated music is output as a MIDI-file. 

In order to generate structured music, the system utilizes different hierarchical structures to represent different musical aspects: 

* Metric representation, i.e. in the time domain, much like sheet music notation. 
* Abstract, hierarchically grouped representation:

    - A full composition consists of a sequence of Sections, which each contain a melody and a chord sequence.
    - Melodies consist of motifs, which then consist of notes. 


The generative process consists of first generating an abstract hierarchical representation of the composition, which is then mapped to a metric representation, thus adding timing and rhythmic information. In order to generate cohesive music, the generative process ensures that repetetion occurs on multiple structural levels, such as motifs, melodies, chord sequences and full sections. This is handled by the top-level module "Composer", which passes generative instructions down to the lower levels. These instructions are contained in the dictionaries "chord_info", "metric_info", and "melodic_info", which are passed to each Section object upon construction. 

Melody hierarchies are transformed to a metric representation before the chords are generated by formulating the harmonization problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem. 




The system was designed with a hybridization approach, 
where each task in the generative process was divided into smaller sub-tasks, which then is solved by the algorithm deemed fitting.
